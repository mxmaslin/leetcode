# Binary search

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search target in nums. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>4</sup> < nums[i], target < 10<sup>4</sup>
- All the integers in nums are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
